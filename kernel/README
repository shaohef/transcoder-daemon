Only tested on Ubuntu 16.04

build.sh is used to build a kernel package. We already included
the package, so this step is not necessary.

install-kernel.sh is used to
1. add user kontron and add the new user to sudo/video group
2. install the kernel package
3. modify grup default entry to this new kernel

Just run 
./install-kernel.sh [$USERNAME]
to install
